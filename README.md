# Crypto-Wallet-Explorer
This is a test Dapp (decentralized application) that works with MetaMask.
It utilizes the Bootstrap framework for the frontend, and web3.js for the logic. Tehcnically, the blockchain is the backend and database.

- Click "Connect to Wallet". This will prompt MetaMask for your signature (basically a login)
- Upon success, the Dapp will show you a shorthand version of your wallet address.
- Then, the application will determine if you're on the Ethereum Chain, or on the Binance Smart Chain.
- If you're on the Ethereum chain, your wallet balance will be in Ethereum.
- If you're on the Binance Smart Chain, your balance will be in BNB.
